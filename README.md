TASK 1
</span>


**Programming experience?**

 Intermediate C# experience, with beginner C++experience, intermediate in Javascript (CSS and Html)/ Angular js and beginner in Java.

**What have we done with micro controllers?**

 I heard of Arduino but never worked on it also never seen the physical hardware  

**Which single board computers have we used?**

 Worked on Raspberry Pi with some students trying help on the projects and have only touched on 

**Are we a part of any maker community?**

 I am not a part of the maker community.
 
**What do we already know about IoT?**

IOT to me only meant interconnected hardware and that is connected to through the internet later stored in the cloud.

TASK 2
</span>

**What does IoT entail:**
physical objects (or groups of suvh objects) that are embedded with sensors, processing abilities, software and technologies that connect the connect data with other devices and systems over the internet or other communications networks 
**Teachers explanation understandings:**
 
**3 domains of IoT:**

mobile services,

smart homes, 

healthcare

**2 commonly used (data) protocols:**

Bluetooth
wifi            
 
**2 typical IoT devices:**

Smart camera
Fitness devices
Connected cars

**After watching the video**
Lawn mower 
Cleaner 
Coffee maker
video doorbells
home control system 


**Benefits of Iot**
The results are in real time 
Automation
Gets more value from products, it allows for a new value proposition
Data generation from connected devices
The shared number of connections is huge
Predictive maintenance
 
**Challenges of IoT**
Some of it still requires some of human interaction ( like him clicking his phone)
Security 
Connecting everything
Lack of skills
The growth is lower
Lot of things needed to make it work – its complex
The cost to implement is wide
Deployment is moving slow
Connectivity is not accepted everywhere
Its difficult in certain spaces to determine who to sell to
Absence of security
Each component in the system can be breached
Shorter battery life for faster speed and this will be problematic on bigger devices, that need a longer battery life
You quickly exhaust the signalling plane
Too much data being generated

TASK 2
</span>

**Why esp8266?**

It changed your life
Less than a dollar, thus it changes the way we design
We can use it in home automation
Programmability and price
You can attach sensors, leds, buttons, screen which allows you to build many things
It's very affordable and allowed students to build their own thing
It bridges the world of software and hardware
It inspired creativity due to the price

**Why is it personally inspiring?**

It is inspiring because it means that we can creatively explore our interests in IoT.

**What's the connection to coffee?**

It is the first one you saw, it's called the espresso lite, then there was a version 2
The chip is less than a $1, so it changes how we design things.
It is priced like a coffee
 

##Day 2 
**Task 1**
IoT architecture terms
**Internet**
The Internet is a world wide network of computers that are connected (networked) and are using the communication method called TCP/IP but that connects to the cloud.

**Server**
IoT Data Server is a "Data Integration Controller" consisting of high reliable industrial computer and non-programming data integration software.
Servers is the cloud and the services being offered in the cloud.

**Cloud**
Once the data is done with the preprocessing and the analysis, 
and all the loopholes are removed from the data, the processed data is sent 
to the data centers and the servers that can be used for the final analysis and reporting purposes.
The cloud is basically where everything is stored.

**Edge**
The step deals with the preprocessing and pre analytics of the data before sending it into the actual systems. 
Edge computing puts storage and servers where the data is.
Edge computing as “a part of a distributed computing topology in which information processing is located close to the edge—where things and people produce or consume that information.”
This kind of computing architecture is always connected to the internet

*Fog**
Fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure or process in which computing resources are located between the data source and the cloud or any other data center.
Fog/ edge devices connect to a gateway

**Swarm**
“The swarm can work w/o internet”
Defined as the collective behaviour of decentralised, self-organised systems, Swarm Intelligence can enable a collection of multiple IoT devices to work together and exchange information, thereby achieving greater utility.
In a swarm, devices are connected to each other
In particular, the discipline focuses on the collective behaviors that result from the local interactions of the individuals with each other and with their environment. 

**Things**
Things are the physical objects in the IoT network, they are the actors and sensors that we connect to our architecture

**Nodes**
“They are our microcontrollers with not much power
Devices with a little bit of computational power, that are in the edge, and things are connected directly to them”

**Gateway**
“A computer where all of our devices are connected and it is connected to the cloud”
The data which is captured by the sensors and actuators is in analog form, 
and to change this analog data into digital data, we need to have a mechanism in place. To work out on this process, the internet gateway is used. With the use of Data Acquisition Systems, 
the analog data can be converted into a digital system and form
